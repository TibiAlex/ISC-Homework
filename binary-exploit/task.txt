# Casino

Hey there, fellow gambler,

Are you good with them numbers? If so, you can try your skills on our new
virtual casino headquartered in Saint Tropez!

You will have plenty of fun and, if you are lucky enough, win a sh!tload of
coins!

You can also train locally using the attached program.

When you are ready to play the real game, the official casino is at the
following address (use a TCP network client to connect):
`isc2023.1337.cx:10009`.

Let's see if you have what it takes!


### Hints:

  - you don't have the source code :P #ghidra
  - there are at least two vulnerabilities you need to exploit to get the flag!
  - try to use some tools on this one (e.g., python + pwntools recommended);
  - you can use netcat (`nc`) for opening a socket pipe ;)
